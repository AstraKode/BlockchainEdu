This section is dedicated towards providing materials and resouces in understanding Blockchain, some of its basic components.

## History


Blockchain technology, first proposed in the early 1980s, gained practical implementation with the advent of Bitcoin, the pioneering public blockchain. Essentially, a blockchain serves as a digital, decentralized ledger, operating on the premise of network support by nodes. Transactions or events within a blockchain require validation by these nodes. Once approved, the transaction becomes immutable, meaning it cannot be altered.

In 2008, during Bitcoin's early stages, an anonymous internet user under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published Bitcoin's whitepaper, outlining the technology and its potential use cases. Blockchain transactions utilize cryptographic algorithms for validation, with Bitcoin employing a consensus mechanism known as proof of work, which involves solving mathematical problems. This mechanism has undergone several modifications, with other blockchains adopting variants, notably Ethereum, which employs a different consensus system called proof of stake.

While specific details may vary, the fundamental concept remains consistent: validators must reach consensus on transaction events for the network to recognize them. Consequently, terms like BTC and blockchain have become ubiquitous. However, blockchains can manifest in various forms and types, with constant innovations enhancing existing chains and introducing new ones.

A crucial component of blockchains is the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing, programmable contracts integrated into the blockchain. This integration allows for the realization of the advantages of decentralized ledger technology (DLT). Blockchain types vary, encompassing Public chains, characterized by universal data transparency, Private chains, which restrict access to permissioned users, and Consortium Blockchains, a hybrid type enabling public and private access to specific individuals and aspects.
