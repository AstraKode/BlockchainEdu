### 1.1) Brief History
Blockchain technology, first proposed in the early 1980s, gained practical implementation with the advent of Bitcoin, the 1st and a pioneer for public blockchains. A blockchain in essence, serves as a digital, decentralized ledger, and operates on the premise of a network supported by nodes. Transactions or events within a blockchain require validation by these nodes. Once approved, the transaction becomes immutable, meaning it cannot be altered. And if public can always be viewed.

In 2008, during Bitcoin's early stages, an anonymous internet user under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published Bitcoin's whitepaper, outlining the technology and its potential use cases. Blockchain transactions utilize cryptographic algorithms for validation, with Bitcoin employing a consensus mechanism known as proof of work, which involves solving mathematical problems. This mechanism has undergone several modifications, with other blockchains adopting variants, notably Ethereum, which employs a different consensus system called proof of stake.

While specific details may vary, the fundamental concept remains consistent: validators must reach consensus on transaction events for the network to recognize them. Consequently, terms like BTC and blockchain have become ubiquitous. However, blockchains can manifest in various forms and types, with constant innovations enhancing existing chains and introducing new ones.

A crucial component of blockchains is the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing, programmable contracts integrated into the blockchain. This integration allows for the realization of the advantages of decentralized ledger technology (DLT). Blockchain types vary, encompassing Public chains, characterized by universal data transparency, Private chains, which restrict access to permissioned users, and Consortium Blockchains, a hybrid type enabling public and private access to specific individuals and aspects.

### 1.4) Tools

Blockchain explorers are tools to view and explore all the information on a blockchain including, transactions, blocks, addresses, and network metrics.  Its important to recognize that interoperability is a siginficant factor to app development and blockchain usage. Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) are blockchains coded using the solidity programming language. Eth also uses this and therefore there exists a high degree of compatability across EVM blockchains. EVM blockchains are still unique but interoperability is a lot easier and smoother.

> [!Warning]
> SOL and BTC not EVM compatible and require dedicated and seperate apps and smartcontract development.

> [!Tip]
> Its useful to think of Different blockchains as seperate unconnected "islands". Some have bridges to other islands and others do not.

> [!Tip]
> In principle though most blockchains are analogous to one another, thus familarity with one generally suffices for understanding basic concepts of others.





## 1.5) Transaction/Wallet Tracing ##
Interacting direclty on chain can be a tricky experience. There is still much room for increased user protection and security. Therefore understanding smart contracts that you and your wallets interact is very important. In addition because the information in public blockchains its a public a good practice to personally verify instead of trust! The tools below help verify transactions, documentation and smartcontract history. Useful for due dilligence and general onchain awareness.

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on blockchain networks, which ensure their immutable execution and decentralization. Essentially, smart contracts automate and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, eliminating the need for intermediaries and increasing transparency and security in transactions. These contracts are triggered by predefined conditions coded into them, and once these conditions are met, the contract executes automatically. Smart contracts have broad applications, ranging from financial transactions and supply chain management to decentralized applications (DApps) and tokenization of assets. They are revolutionizing industries by streamlining processes, reducing costs, and enhancing trust in digital interactions.

## 3.2) Dapp-development

Developing decentralized applications (DApps) involves several key steps to ensure their functionality, security, and usability. Here's a basic outline of the process:

1. Define the Concept: Clearly define the purpose and functionality of your DApp. Identify the problem it solves or the value it provides to users within a decentralized environment.

2. Choose a Blockchain Platform: Select a suitable blockchain platform for your DApp based on factors such as scalability, consensus mechanism, development tools, and community support. Popular choices include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot.

3. Design Smart Contracts: Develop smart contracts that govern the logic and rules of your DApp. This involves coding in a blockchain-specific language like Solidity (for Ethereum) or Vyper. Ensure that the smart contracts are secure, efficient, and audited to prevent vulnerabilities.

4. Develop Frontend Interface: Design and develop the user interface (UI) for your DApp, including web or mobile interfaces. Use frameworks like React.js or Angular.js for frontend development to create a seamless user experience.

5. Implement Backend Infrastructure: Set up the necessary backend infrastructure to interact with the blockchain network. This may involve deploying nodes, setting up API endpoints, and integrating with blockchain data sources.

6. Test and Debug: Thoroughly test your DApp to identify and fix any bugs or issues. Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and security of your application.

7. Deploy to Testnet: Deploy your DApp to a testnet environment (e.g., Ropsten for Ethereum) for further testing and validation. Testnet deployments simulate the conditions of the mainnet without incurring real transaction costs.

8. Security Audit: Conduct a security audit of your DApp, including smart contracts, frontend code, and backend infrastructure. Engage with third-party security experts or auditing firms to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

9. Deploy to Mainnet: Once your DApp passes testing and security audits, deploy it to the mainnet for public use. Mainnet deployment involves real transactions and interactions with actual users, so ensure that everything is thoroughly vetted and ready for production.

10. Community Engagement: Engage with the blockchain community to promote your DApp, gather feedback from users, and address any issues or feature requests. Continuously iterate and improve your DApp based on user feedback and market dynamics.
By following these steps, you can successfully develop and deploy a decentralized application that leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide innovative solutions to real-world problems.
